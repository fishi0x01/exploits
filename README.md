# exploits

Build automation for multiple known exploits.

**The exploits are not written by me. I do not deserve any credit.**

This repo helps me to keep the compilation for target platforms in a simple manner.
The origin of each exploit is declared inside its dedicated README.

## General advice

Do not use exploits blindly! Verify if an exploit is actually doing what it claims to do. 
If you are not sure then do not run it or at the very least run it in a *secure* sandboxed environment first. However, sandboxes are not 100% failsafe.

Scanning or running exploits without the target infrastructure owner's consent is a crime. 
Act responsibly, also in your own interest.

## Vagrant workbenches

This repo contains vagrant boxes that can be used as workbenches for buffer overflows for different platforms and architectures.
